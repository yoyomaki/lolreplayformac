#League of Legends Replay Shell Script For Mac Users

Many websites provide \*.bat file for game replay, where you may find that it does not work on Mac. Download the \*.bat file of the game you wanna watch from any websites, for example *lolking.com*.        

+ step 1: find the string in that \*.bat file in the formation of "spectator replays.lolking.net:80 ******************** NA1"
+ step 2: copy the entire string together with quotation marks.
+ step 3: paste the string into my shell script replacing AddHere on the last line.
+ step 4: run the shell script. In terminal, command is "sh scriptname.sh".
+ step 5: also you can use CodeRunner by clicking Run.
+ step 6: Note: this shell script also works on Spectator Mode if you know the game address.
